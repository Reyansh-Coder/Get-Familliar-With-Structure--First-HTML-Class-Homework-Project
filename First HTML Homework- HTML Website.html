    <h2 style="color:blue">Introduction to HTML</h2>
    <p> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It structures content on the
        web, which is styled and enhanced with CSS and JavaScript. </p>
    <h2 style="color:purple"> Basic HTML Structure </h2>
    <p> An HTML document begins with the !DOCTYPE html declaration, which specifies that the document follows the HTML5
        standard. This declaration is not technically an HTML tag, but it is a necessary instruction that tells the web
        browser how to interpret the HTML code. The next element is the html tag, which acts as the root of the entire
        HTML document. Everything on a web page is contained within this html element, and it signifies to the browser
        that the enclosed code is an HTML document.

        Within the html tag, there are two primary sections: the head section and the body section. The head element
        contains meta-information about the document that is not directly displayed on the webpage but is used by the
        browser and search engines. Inside the head, you typically find the title element, which defines the title of
        the webpage that appears on the browser tab. For example, in the provided code, the title is set as "My Web
        Page". This title is important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and helps users identify your page in
        browser tabs or bookmarks.

        Following the head section is the body element, which contains all the visible content of the webpage. Anything
        between the body tags will be rendered and displayed to the user on the screen. In this example, the only
        content inside the body is a h1 tag, which defines a top-level heading. The content between the opening and
        closing h1 tags—"Hello World!"—is displayed as a large, bold heading on the page. HTML uses heading tags (h1>,
        h2, and so on) to define the importance of the text, with h1 being the most important and typically used for
        main titles.

        Finally, the HTML document ends with a closing /html tag, which signifies the end of the HTML document. This
        ensures that the browser knows the document structure is complete. </p>
    <h2 style="color:yellow">HTML Basics</h2>
    <p> HTML Document Structure starts with the declaration of the document type using !DOCTYPE html to indicate that
        the document is an HTML5 document. This is followed by the html tag, which encompasses the entire HTML document.

        Head Section contains meta-information about the document. The head tag includes elements like the title tag,
        which specifies the title of the web page displayed in the browser tab, and meta tags that provide metadata such
        as character encoding and viewport settings.

        Body Section is where all the content that is visible to users is placed. This includes text, images, links, and
        multimedia elements. The body tag wraps all content displayed on the web page.

        Headings are defined using heading tags from h1 to h6. The h1 tag represents the most important heading, while
        h6 represents the least important. Headings help structure the content and improve accessibility.

        Paragraphs are created using the p tag. This tag is used to define blocks of text, providing a clear and
        structured presentation of content.

        Links are created with the a tag. The href attribute specifies the URL the link points to. Links can be used to
        navigate to other pages or resources.

        Images are embedded using the img tag, with the src attribute pointing to the image file location and the alt
        attribute providing alternative text for accessibility.

        Lists can be ordered or unordered. Unordered lists are created with the ul tag, and each list item is defined
        with the li tag. Ordered lists use the ol tag for numbered items.

        Div and Span Elements are used as generic containers for grouping content. The div tag is a block-level element,
        while the span tag is an inline element. These tags are often used with CSS for styling.

        Forms are used to collect user input and are defined with the form tag. Input elements within forms, such as
        text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons, enable user interaction and data submission.

        Semantic Elements such as header, footer, nav, article, section, and aside help define the structure and meaning
        of content. These elements improve accessibility and SEO by providing context to the content.

        Comments can be added in HTML using the syntax that begins with !-- and ends with --. Comments are not displayed
        in the browser and are used to annotate code for better understanding. </p>
    <h2 style="color:red">Intermediate HTML</h2>
    <p> Tables are created using the table tag, which organizes data in rows and columns. Each row is defined with the
        tr tag. Within each row, individual data cells are marked with the td tag, while header cells are marked with
        the th tag. Tables can include attributes like border, cellpadding, and cellspacing to control their appearance.

        Forms are constructed with the form tag and allow for user input. Various input elements are used, including
        input for text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and password fields. The select tag creates dropdown menus,
        and the textarea tag allows for multi-line text input. The action attribute specifies where to send the form
        data, while the method attribute indicates how to send it (GET or POST).

        Multimedia elements include the audio and video tags. The audio tag allows you to embed audio files, with
        attributes like controls for playback controls and autoplay to start playback automatically. The video tag
        enables embedding video content, also supporting attributes like controls, width, and height.

        Semantic HTML enhances the structure of web pages. Elements like header, nav, main, section, article, aside, and
        footer provide meaning to the content. These elements improve accessibility and SEO by clearly defining the
        layout and purpose of different sections of the page.

        Images are embedded using the img tag, with attributes like src for the image source and alt for alternative
        text describing the image. This ensures accessibility for screen readers.

        Links are created with the a tag, where the href attribute specifies the target URL. The target attribute can
        control how links open, with _blank opening them in a new tab.

        Lists can be ordered or unordered. An unordered list is created with the ul tag, and each list item is defined
        with the li tag. An ordered list uses the ol tag for numbered items.

        Meta tags in the head section provide metadata about the HTML document, such as character encoding with meta
        charset equals UTF-8 and viewport settings for responsive design with meta name equals viewport content equals
        width equals device-width, initial-scale equals 1.0.

        CSS styling can be applied directly within HTML using the style tag in the head, or through external stylesheets
        linked with the link tag. This allows for customized styling of HTML elements, improving the visual presentation
        of the web page. </p>
    <h2 style="color:magenta">Advanced HTML</h2>
    <p> APIs and Data Attributes allow you to enhance HTML elements with custom data. Using the data attribute, you can
        store extra information directly in HTML tags, which can be accessed with JavaScript for dynamic functionality.
        This is useful for interactive web applications.

        HTML5 APIs provide built-in functionalities that allow for advanced features on web pages. For example, the
        Geolocation API allows websites to access the user's location, the Web Storage API provides local storage
        capabilities for saving user data, and the Canvas API enables drawing graphics on the fly.

        Responsive Design involves using the meta tag for viewport settings and employing media queries within CSS to
        ensure that web pages look good on various devices. By adjusting layout and styling based on screen size, you
        can create a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

        Accessibility Features are crucial for making web content usable for all users, including those with
        disabilities. Using semantic elements like header, nav, main, and footer improves screen reader support.
        Additionally, providing alt text for images and proper labels for form elements enhances accessibility.

        Microdata and Schema.org allow you to add structured data to your HTML to improve SEO and how search engines
        interpret your content. By using specific attributes, you can define entities and relationships in your content,
        making it more understandable for search engines.

        Forms with Advanced Input Types in HTML5 include types like email, date, number, and range, which provide
        built-in validation and user-friendly interfaces. These types enhance user experience by offering specific
        controls and automatically validating input.

        IFrames enable you to embed another HTML document within the current one. This is useful for displaying content
        from other websites or applications without redirecting users away from your page. The iframe tag supports
        attributes like src for the source URL and width and height for size.

        Custom Elements and Web Components allow you to create reusable and encapsulated HTML elements with custom
        behavior. Using the Custom Elements API, you can define new HTML tags and use them throughout your application,
        promoting code reusability.

        Progressive Enhancement and Graceful Degradation are strategies for building web applications that ensure core
        functionality works for all users, regardless of their browser capabilities. By layering features, you can
        provide a basic experience that improves with advanced browser support.

        Template and Slot Elements in HTML5 provide a way to create reusable chunks of markup that can be instantiated
        in different contexts. The template tag holds client-side content that will not be rendered until it is
        explicitly instantiated with JavaScript. The slot tag is used within web components to define placeholders for
        distributed content. </p>
